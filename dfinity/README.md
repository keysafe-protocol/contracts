# The basic structure of this shuttle-token is based on ic-token-example provided by rocklabs
# https://github.com/rocklabs-io

# for mint, burn, transfer, sp token works as a basic dfinity token
# above that, sp token provides 4 new API including:
- registerNode
- registerUser
- recoverStart
- recoverFinish
# so that user and node could use token to record their behavior.
